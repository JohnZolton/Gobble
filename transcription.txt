[00:00:00 --> 00:00:03]  If you wanted to create on purpose a
[00:00:04 --> 00:00:08]  Diabolically pathogenic farming system you could not
[00:00:09 --> 00:00:12]  Create conceive build a
[00:00:12 --> 00:00:14]  more effective system
[00:00:14 --> 00:00:23]  than factory farming. That's where we are. It's a little bit woo woo, but I dare to ask the question. Can we eat happiness?
[00:00:25 --> 00:00:27]  Or can we eat abuse?
[00:00:28 --> 00:00:34]  And I would suggest, you know, we say you are what you eat. Well, you know, if what we're eating
[00:00:34 --> 00:00:37]  lives a life of stress and abuse and disrespect
[00:00:39 --> 00:00:44]  Does that translate? Is there any translation there into us?
[00:00:44 --> 00:00:46]  Compared to an animal that's lived a happy, comfortable
[00:00:48 --> 00:00:54]  Respectful life, you know, respecting the thickness of the pig, the chickenness of the chicken. Nobody in any of these
[00:00:55 --> 00:00:56]  institutions is doing research
[00:00:57 --> 00:00:59]  on the benefits of
[00:00:59 --> 00:01:00]  happy pigs
[00:01:02 --> 00:01:10]  The only question is can we grow them faster, fatter, bigger cheaper? That's the only question. Nobody's asking about happiness
[00:01:11 --> 00:01:18]  And I would suggest that if that became the the foundational question of all of our research
[00:01:19 --> 00:01:21]  Maybe we would start growing
[00:01:21 --> 00:01:29]  healthier animals healthier food and we would actually have happier healthier people as a result of figuring out how to grow happy or healthier
[00:01:29 --> 00:01:31]  plants and animals
[00:01:33 --> 00:01:39]  Joel Salaton is joining me today my friends. He is the American farmer author,
[00:01:39 --> 00:01:44]  Lecturer and libertarian raising livestock on polyface farm in Virginia
[00:01:45 --> 00:01:51]  Extremely excited to get into this conversation. I have known your name for quite a while and
[00:01:51 --> 00:01:56]  Charles Mayfield brought up and we did our podcast together talking about his company and
[00:01:56 --> 00:02:02]  I knew it was time to get some more regenerative farming voices in here. I had Jacob Wolke on a while back people really like that episode
[00:02:02 --> 00:02:06]  So I'm very excited to have you here Joel. Thank you for joining me today.
[00:02:06 --> 00:02:09]  Thank you Ben. It's an honor and a light to be with you. Yeah.
[00:02:10 --> 00:02:17]  So I was listening to your other podcast last night going around. I'm actually here in Wohaka, Mexico right now.
[00:02:17 --> 00:02:25]  So I'm recording from a hostel in in this little Mexican village and you are recording from rural Virginia. So it's going to be a miracle of this works
[00:02:25 --> 00:02:32]  Policy, but we're going to take a shot. I was walking around my town last night and listening to your
[00:02:32 --> 00:02:39]  episode. You've done two episodes of Joe Rogan. You started your own podcast to go really deep. So
[00:02:39 --> 00:02:45]  one of the things I could not actually find though, interestingly enough was just a full backstory from you from
[00:02:45 --> 00:02:51]  where you came from and how you got to this point where you are today where you're one of the top voices in this
[00:02:51 --> 00:02:57]  very exciting regenerative farming movement. So could we get just a background on where you came from? How you got into this space?
[00:02:58 --> 00:03:04]  Well, so my grandfather, my dad's dad was a charter subscriber to Rodel's organic gardening and farming
[00:03:04 --> 00:03:12]  magazine. We started out in like whatever 1945 something like that. And so you know dad's a little and so
[00:03:13 --> 00:03:23]  he grew up that way, the biological approach and dad had a had a desire to farm, but you know Midwesterner,
[00:03:23 --> 00:03:30]  no money, no land, what do you do? And always right to you know go to the new new thing. And so he
[00:03:30 --> 00:03:42]  conceived a plan of going to a developing country where land was cheaper and less whatever, less
[00:03:44 --> 00:03:51]  he got he went into the Navy and World War II flew in the Navy, got out and on the GI bill went to the
[00:03:51 --> 00:03:58]  Indiana University and and got his degree in economics, business administration, which a Middlebury in
[00:03:58 --> 00:04:05]  Vermont for a semester in Spanish, hitchhike hitchhike from Vermont to Mexico and spent six months in
[00:04:05 --> 00:04:12]  Mexico came back instead for the foreign civil service exam that you know all like American diplomats and
[00:04:12 --> 00:04:17]  stuff like that, I have to pass, passed it the first time and got on as a bilingual accountant with
[00:04:17 --> 00:04:23]  Texas oil company eventually it became Texaco, but Texas oil company there in the Wildcat oil
[00:04:23 --> 00:04:37]  fields off of Venezuela in like 1940, okay, 48 or 47. And anyway, so he's there and he's saving money,
[00:04:37 --> 00:04:44]  got married and they went down and and in some years was able to save enough money to buy a thousand
[00:04:44 --> 00:04:49]  acre farm in the islands of Venezuela and began raising chickens and then they had my older brother
[00:04:49 --> 00:04:58]  than they had me and so we're there on the farm and very quickly we took the entire local chicken
[00:04:58 --> 00:05:05]  production business away from the other farmers because our chickens were so clean and that instead
[00:05:05 --> 00:05:10]  of the other farmers wanting to know how we did it they accused us of witchcraft and voodooism and
[00:05:10 --> 00:05:18]  all this stuff and so when there was a hunta in 1959 of Petus Petus and Menus 1959 and 60 hunta
[00:05:19 --> 00:05:25]  it gave what happens when there's lawlessness is that it gives license for think for
[00:05:25 --> 00:05:29]  score to be settled that wouldn't be settled otherwise you know under more normal circumstances
[00:05:30 --> 00:05:36]  and so basically you know we fled the back doors the machine guns came in front door lost everything
[00:05:36 --> 00:05:42]  and tried to get protection you know dad went to every minute I was I was four years old my brother was
[00:05:42 --> 00:05:50]  seven and and dad met with every you know the the interior minister secretary of whatever of the
[00:05:50 --> 00:05:56]  treasury sector all the cabinet level and nobody you know could do anything and so the only thing
[00:05:56 --> 00:06:03]  was to was to believe the country and so we did we came back to the US land and in Philadelphia
[00:06:04 --> 00:06:13]  Easter Sunday 1961 and dad really wanted to go back you know he you know he died young he died at
[00:06:13 --> 00:06:19]  66 which seems really young to me now and but he he left his heart and soul he loved he loved the
[00:06:19 --> 00:06:24]  country he loved the the climate he loved the people he loved the culture everything about it was
[00:06:24 --> 00:06:28]  really good and he had these two boys coming on you know he had his yeah his labor force coming
[00:06:28 --> 00:06:33]  on you know we're ready to take this and he had great you know great customers I mean it was it was
[00:06:33 --> 00:06:40]  really good and so that's why he didn't go back as a family we didn't go back to the Midwest
[00:06:40 --> 00:06:46]  where all of our relatives were mom was from Ohio dad was a Indiana instead we settled here in
[00:06:46 --> 00:06:52]  this Virginia Shendou Valley which was three hours away from DC so that if things settled in Venezuela
[00:06:52 --> 00:06:57]  in a few hours dad could be it we could be at the Venezuelan embassy could paper stand and be
[00:06:57 --> 00:07:03]  back on the farm in Venezuela well that never happened but that's why we ended up here and of course
[00:07:03 --> 00:07:09]  we didn't have any money he didn't we lost everything and so bought the most gully rock pile in the whole
[00:07:10 --> 00:07:18]  area and it was very very cheap and and and started over and I remember dad was 39 I remember when I hit
[00:07:18 --> 00:07:24]  39 you know wondering man if I lost it all would I would I do something different or I start over again
[00:07:24 --> 00:07:31]  you know and so you know dad was tenacious and persistent and we started it over well the first
[00:07:31 --> 00:07:36]  question was well how do I make a living on this farm and I remember as a little child five and six
[00:07:36 --> 00:07:45]  years old ex ex-perce coming government experts private experts consultants how do we do and every
[00:07:45 --> 00:07:52]  single one I'm every single one so this is you know 1962 every single one of them was plant corn
[00:07:52 --> 00:07:58]  use chemicals build silos bar more money run that cows through through the forest those kinds of
[00:07:58 --> 00:08:07]  things and and dad viewed the chemical chemical approach as as a drug addiction you know you you
[00:08:07 --> 00:08:12]  got to you got to use more toxic stuff more expensive stuff to get the same hit all the time
[00:08:12 --> 00:08:17]  and as he's a year on his youngest treadmill and so he knew that wasn't the answer but
[00:08:18 --> 00:08:25]  we started into the in a period of of of experimentation and just to to keep food on you know to keep
[00:08:25 --> 00:08:29]  shoes on our feet you know mom took a job as a school teacher she was a high school
[00:08:29 --> 00:08:34]  um health and his head teacher and dad took a job as an accountant at a local you know accounting
[00:08:34 --> 00:08:39]  firm he was you know business and all that and and that the off farm job is gradually paid for the
[00:08:39 --> 00:08:47]  mortgage over the next 10 years but it was a time of intense experimentation and we started experimenting
[00:08:47 --> 00:08:52]  dead developed a portable electric fencing system we started moving the animals around we were
[00:08:52 --> 00:08:58]  reading you know Andre voice-in stuff you know Allen savory wasn't around yet but Andre voice-in
[00:08:58 --> 00:09:07]  was and and started seeing some of that portable infrastructure you know composting you know different
[00:09:07 --> 00:09:13]  things we got a wood chipper to to be able to start composting and making a long story short you
[00:09:13 --> 00:09:18]  know by the by the time I was in high school we had a lot of experiments and had some
[00:09:19 --> 00:09:26]  shall we say confirmation under our belt that we were headed a right direction we could we could see
[00:09:26 --> 00:09:34]  some fertility coming up we could see you know animal health increasing and so when I was 10 years
[00:09:34 --> 00:09:41]  old I got my first chickens from sears and road buck and put them in a little cardboard box you know
[00:09:41 --> 00:09:46]  with a heat lamp and and raised them up and I started a laying a laying chicken enterprise that
[00:09:46 --> 00:09:53]  ten years old had that all through high school and we had an old um an old curd market
[00:09:53 --> 00:09:59]  this was a precursor to today's farmers markets it was a depression era uh curbed we called
[00:09:59 --> 00:10:05]  curmarket in in stanton I don't know how many of them other there were around the state of the
[00:10:05 --> 00:10:13]  country but uh this one in 1930s and 40s was it was like a local Walmart I mean it was the place to
[00:10:13 --> 00:10:21]  be on Saturday Saturday mornings and you know during the depression farmers had food and no money
[00:10:21 --> 00:10:29]  and people in the city needed food you know in in 1946 been the average the average
[00:10:29 --> 00:10:37]  morsel of food in the in the US in 1946 only traveled on average 40 miles from farm to plate
[00:10:37 --> 00:10:44]  average today is 1500 miles okay so you know you had these there there was a very local you know
[00:10:44 --> 00:10:52]  localized kind of system and so the curbarker was established by the time I came and you know whatever
[00:10:52 --> 00:10:59]  in 1972 you know I'm like 14 and and dad being an accountant and realized as a small farm
[00:10:59 --> 00:11:06]  we had to get retail dollar we could we couldn't compete uh in the commodity business because the
[00:11:06 --> 00:11:11]  margins were too slim we had to start wearing the middle man hatch you know the processor the
[00:11:11 --> 00:11:16]  distributor the marketer we needed to get more of that retail dollar if we were going to make it
[00:11:16 --> 00:11:24]  so I joined the curb market at about 14 and there were it was very very small at that
[00:11:24 --> 00:11:32]  once one did baked goods and one was kind of a glorified homestead they cured some pork and she
[00:11:32 --> 00:11:39]  did vegetables and and some baked items as well and then I came with all the animal meats of you know
[00:11:39 --> 00:11:45]  beef and pork and chicken and eggs and then I had a garden as well you know during those years and
[00:11:45 --> 00:11:54]  so so during you know from about 14 to 18 through high school I was up every Saturday morning at 4
[00:11:54 --> 00:12:00]  clock every it was a year round market every single week of the year down there at six the market
[00:12:00 --> 00:12:10]  opened at six o'clock closed at about you know 10 30 or 11 and so sold our stuff and
[00:12:11 --> 00:12:16]  it was uh you know I wouldn't trade that experience for anything those two old ladies you know
[00:12:16 --> 00:12:21]  obviously they were old enough to be my grandmother's but they took me under wing they showed me
[00:12:21 --> 00:12:29]  how to talk to customers how to display stuff how to how to deal with happy people and
[00:12:29 --> 00:12:34]  unhappy people you know all those wonderful marketing things and you know I was just a teen and
[00:12:34 --> 00:12:40]  I I to this day I think I think I probably elongated their time there because as soon as I
[00:12:40 --> 00:12:47]  closed it down and went to college nobody else in a family was you know had the the sabbiet to take over the the
[00:12:47 --> 00:12:53]  vendor stand shortly after I went to college the two ladies quit and and the far then the curb market
[00:12:53 --> 00:12:58]  was no more but the thing to understand about the curb market was there was a memorandum of understanding
[00:12:58 --> 00:13:07]  between the healthy department and the extension service that if if a vendor was was was receiving
[00:13:07 --> 00:13:13]  extension service bulletin you know so for me I had to join for age for them it was being in the
[00:13:13 --> 00:13:21]  extension homemaker's club then we were exempt from all the government regulations on food so
[00:13:21 --> 00:13:26]  we could you know we could butcher beef in the backyard and sell roundstakes and ground beef you know
[00:13:26 --> 00:13:31]  there without inspection we we looked a couple of emergency cows you know I could sell butter
[00:13:31 --> 00:13:38]  cottage cheese I could sell everything but raw milk without any inspection whatsoever and so I grew up as a teen
[00:13:39 --> 00:13:49]  under this wonderful inspection exemption nobody ever got sick you know nobody but I I I appreciated
[00:13:50 --> 00:14:00]  the you know what that kind of freedom offered for for competition in the marketplace and
[00:14:00 --> 00:14:07]  so I go to college and now I'm thinking you know and I love the farm I I had I have older brother
[00:14:07 --> 00:14:12]  younger sister they they left it as soon as they could leave but I wanted to be here I wanted to stay here
[00:14:13 --> 00:14:20]  and so now I'm doing the dad thing I you know the same thing dad said how do I make a living on this little farm
[00:14:20 --> 00:14:28]  and and so I I conceived of a plan that I could milk 10 cows and sell the milk you know
[00:14:28 --> 00:14:34]  neighbors the only problem was it was illegal raw milk was illegal and I've never really gotten over that so I went to college
[00:14:34 --> 00:14:44]  and I I gradually formed this is water gate you know and I gradually formulated a plan oh I know I could I could
[00:14:45 --> 00:14:53]  you know right up I can go be a journalist I had a flare for writing and I knew that so I can go
[00:14:53 --> 00:15:00]  be a journalist and find my deep throat and write a bestseller you know bring the next president down
[00:15:00 --> 00:15:08]  they're all corrupt you know and so you know I'll do that and then I'll retire to the farm you know
[00:15:08 --> 00:15:15]  that was the idea and so I actually worked part time in high school as a local newspaper they like me
[00:15:15 --> 00:15:21]  and they said as soon as you got out of college we'll you know we'll bring on staff and so that was
[00:15:21 --> 00:15:27]  you know that was a neat you know on trace so I graduated went down sure enough you know went right
[00:15:27 --> 00:15:34]  on a newspaper staff and became an investigative reporter and I'm I'm living at home and I'm still
[00:15:34 --> 00:15:39]  how do I get back to this farm full-time you know and so Theresa and I married and
[00:15:40 --> 00:15:45]  we're living in the attic of the farmhouse we remodely attic I'm sure that was illegal without a
[00:15:45 --> 00:15:51]  permit but we did it anyway remodely attic of the farmhouse later so you know instead of the attic we
[00:15:51 --> 00:15:58]  called it our penthouse and and we began living out of the garden we had firewood we had our own heat
[00:15:58 --> 00:16:05]  we didn't have a mortgage we didn't have a rent we drove a $50 car we lived on $300 a month
[00:16:06 --> 00:16:11]  and even though neither one of us had hot-paying jobs we were able to save half of our paychecks
[00:16:11 --> 00:16:19]  so in two years we saved up enough that that we could live for a year and so step 10 to 24
[00:16:21 --> 00:16:27]  1982 I walked out of that newspaper office jumped off the cliff and came home full-time
[00:16:27 --> 00:16:33]  just you know because we had enough to live on for a year I didn't think we'd make it but
[00:16:34 --> 00:16:43]  we we did and living cheaply and frugally and all that we we made it and and and leverage the
[00:16:43 --> 00:16:50]  experiments that dad had instigated during the 60s and 70s we were able to leverage those
[00:16:51 --> 00:16:59]  it took us about three years to exhale you know I think we're gonna make it you know it took us three
[00:16:59 --> 00:17:06]  years but at three years we we we realized yes we were gonna make it and and then it just gradually
[00:17:06 --> 00:17:12]  continued to increase and increase you know with the beef the the pastured livestock and
[00:17:13 --> 00:17:24]  and today the farm generates about 22 02 full-time salaries and you know it's kind of a
[00:17:24 --> 00:17:29]  it's a big deal to us might not be a big deal for others but it's a big deal to us and we've just been
[00:17:29 --> 00:17:39]  very very blessed to see this this trajectory. Thank you so much for sharing all that that's
[00:17:39 --> 00:17:43]  that's fantastic I really like that and and you mentioned how Venezuela is a part of that early
[00:17:43 --> 00:17:49]  story it's so unfortunate how that country just continues to be yeah the aunt will of what we
[00:17:49 --> 00:17:54]  have to not let happen for you know for where we are right I have spent some time in South America
[00:17:54 --> 00:17:59]  I lived in Columbia for quite a bit the last couple of years and met quite a few events
[00:17:59 --> 00:18:05]  way on people who just told stories about what's happening and I do a lot of content about Bitcoin here
[00:18:05 --> 00:18:12]  and and we learn about like inflation and economics and why why money printing always ends madly
[00:18:12 --> 00:18:17]  and that is unfortunately the country we always point to you say see this will happens you know if
[00:18:17 --> 00:18:22]  you just if you don't if you are careful and you just let the government run a buck with with a money
[00:18:23 --> 00:18:32]  and so many people are just feeling safe in the fact that we are from the USA and just think that
[00:18:32 --> 00:18:36]  this couldn't happen to us but I'm sure you're just like your industry like we all need to really
[00:18:36 --> 00:18:42]  be thinking like you know we have a few extra ways to kick the can then places like Venezuela but
[00:18:42 --> 00:18:47]  we are all heading in the same direction if we don't make really aggressive change right now and
[00:18:47 --> 00:18:52]  I think that's very similar to what you're doing you know we need to make aggressive change and how our
[00:18:52 --> 00:18:58]  food is produced and processed and distributed and I think this is probably a good
[00:18:59 --> 00:19:05]  transition here we are no strangers on the show to ramping on the woes of government intervention
[00:19:05 --> 00:19:11]  and regulation and inspectors and permits and all these different things that we're told are
[00:19:11 --> 00:19:16]  they're to keep us safe and protect us but listening and reading your work is really
[00:19:16 --> 00:19:22]  highlighted for me how the food production and food industry in general is the most important place to
[00:19:22 --> 00:19:28]  have a true free market without all of that centralized power intervening so could you give me
[00:19:28 --> 00:19:34]  just a little bit of an overview of where where the food industry is at right now and it's
[00:19:34 --> 00:19:38]  it's crazy listen your story all the way back to the 60s are already pushing chemicals onto
[00:19:38 --> 00:19:44]  these food producers like that's further back I would expect but this is a deep issue and I think
[00:19:44 --> 00:19:50]  I remember hearing you saying on one of your past interviews that you collect books and resources
[00:19:50 --> 00:19:56]  on agriculture but you don't touch anything after the 50s or something was it something like that
[00:19:56 --> 00:20:01]  because they just started going haywire after that and just started going off the wrong direction
[00:20:03 --> 00:20:07]  so sorry kind of a lot of questions at once here I guess so we just get there's how it's talking about
[00:20:09 --> 00:20:14]  what what's your general overview of where we are right now in terms of the food system and
[00:20:14 --> 00:20:19]  maybe we can then start looking into what the biggest problems are how we can start going on
[00:20:19 --> 00:20:28]  and solving those problems yeah probably thank you for for all that probably the the quickest
[00:20:28 --> 00:20:38]  way to say where we are in our food system is to realize that the U.S. leads the world we're number one
[00:20:38 --> 00:20:42]  now there there are things you want to be number one we just had the Olympics we want to have
[00:20:42 --> 00:20:49]  best basketball team right goodness you Simone Biles I mean you got a lover right yes he's an
[00:20:49 --> 00:20:55]  American you know so there are the things you want to be number one in but you don't want to be number
[00:20:55 --> 00:21:01]  one in the world in chronic non infectious disease morbidity that's not where you want to be number
[00:21:01 --> 00:21:12]  one but we are I mean think of all the other countries in the world think of the think of the
[00:21:12 --> 00:21:22]  whatever you know and and we lead the world in chronic non infectious morbidity disease you know heart disease
[00:21:24 --> 00:21:33]  obesity diabetes cancer all those things which were which were relatively unheard of
[00:21:34 --> 00:21:42]  in 1900 I mean you just then you know the number the number one cause of death among women was
[00:21:42 --> 00:21:47]  during childbirth number two cause of death among women if you take out the childbirth the number
[00:21:47 --> 00:21:54]  the number one cause of death among women was burns you know these great big hoops skirts and they were
[00:21:54 --> 00:21:58]  you know and they flush around and catch them in the fire next thing you know there goes
[00:21:58 --> 00:22:04]  all up in flames you know and so it was burns they didn't have good burn units and everybody was
[00:22:04 --> 00:22:12]  cooking a lot of heart and open fire so you know so that was the mortality of that day men men
[00:22:12 --> 00:22:23]  the biggest mortality was was was cuts you know axis ax handles and and you know injury injury
[00:22:23 --> 00:22:30]  was you know was the number one thing and so so here we are at this stage and well and the other
[00:22:30 --> 00:22:36]  course was was infectious disease you know uh typhus and and smallpox and things like that
[00:22:38 --> 00:22:46]  today we're into this you know we're into this time now we're actually our life expectancy is actually
[00:22:46 --> 00:22:53]  dropping for the first time in in history and we have a new lexicon I mean you're not that
[00:22:53 --> 00:23:01]  old-bent but I'm old enough to remember uh when you nobody even heard the terms camp of
[00:23:01 --> 00:23:08]  a backter list area e coli salmonella food allergy that that phrase was not invented until about
[00:23:08 --> 00:23:14]  you know whatever 20 years ago you know when I was a kid if you wanted to have a birthday party
[00:23:14 --> 00:23:20]  for a bunch of three year olds you just had a birthday party today all the moms have to spend a week
[00:23:20 --> 00:23:24]  communicating with each other of well what's your kid allergic to you know what can we have what can we
[00:23:24 --> 00:23:37]  not have and so what I'm what I'm suggesting is that this new um um lexicon this new lexicon is essentially
[00:23:38 --> 00:23:49]  nature um nature begging us as stewards and please enough stop you know stop of stop abusing me stop
[00:23:49 --> 00:23:57]  you know disrespecting me and and this is this is the you know this is nature's balance sheet
[00:23:57 --> 00:24:07]  if you will you know we say nature bats last and so um so perhaps the reason we live we we the u.s
[00:24:07 --> 00:24:16]  leads the world not only in uh in non-infectious chronic morbidity but also we lead the world
[00:24:16 --> 00:24:24]  in health expense nobody even comes close to the per capita expenditure that we do on on um health
[00:24:24 --> 00:24:32]  health care in this country not even close and you know isn't isn't a stretch to think well maybe
[00:24:32 --> 00:24:38]  maybe we lead the world in these things because we invented McDonald's because we invented
[00:24:38 --> 00:24:45]  concentrated animal feeding operations because we invented uh we didn't invent we didn't invent
[00:24:46 --> 00:24:52]  vegetable oils but we invented crisco we we you know vegetable oils were invented in Germany
[00:24:52 --> 00:25:00]  as for for diesel fuel and lubrication and we decided to make food out of them and uh basically invented
[00:25:00 --> 00:25:08]  the hydrogenated vegetable oil you know uh craze uh margarine and and you know all those things uh
[00:25:08 --> 00:25:14]  as opposed to butter we invented DDT we I mean I could we now we've invented genetically modified
[00:25:14 --> 00:25:22]  organisms um you know when you go down the path of of what we have created as a country
[00:25:22 --> 00:25:30]  culture you realize oh you connect the dots well maybe because we did all these things over here
[00:25:30 --> 00:25:37]  is creating all these things over here and so our food system right now our food system is completely
[00:25:37 --> 00:25:48]  dominated by a by a mechanical philosophy toward life um food is fundamentally
[00:25:50 --> 00:26:00]  life it is fundamentally biological biological it is not mechanical and so so a tomato is far more
[00:26:00 --> 00:26:07]  complex the soil is far more complex than just the anatomy of an automobile or even the
[00:26:07 --> 00:26:15]  the guts of a computer as complex as that is you know our our bodies been our uh you know we've
[00:26:15 --> 00:26:25]  got you know MIT says we're only 15% human we're 85% non-human you know 85% of us is you know microbs
[00:26:25 --> 00:26:32]  things that actually aren't human and and so we have some quadrillion quadrillion
[00:26:33 --> 00:26:42]  relationships and decisions being made per second by by beings I mean when when I was in when I was
[00:26:42 --> 00:26:48]  in uh high school I remember you know looking at cells and we thought you know we knew the cells
[00:26:48 --> 00:26:54]  had had pieces in them you know the the nucleus and things but that was about as small as we got
[00:26:54 --> 00:27:05]  now now we know that a cell has up to a thousand mitochondria for cell think about that as small
[00:27:05 --> 00:27:11]  as a cell is it has over a thousand mitochondria in there and that's just one little you know one
[00:27:11 --> 00:27:20]  little component um what we understand now of the way fungi you know fungi talk uh leaves talk
[00:27:21 --> 00:27:28]  molts talk I mean it not the whole cosmos is pulsing with sentience and relational
[00:27:28 --> 00:27:35]  understanding and decision making and so to to come waiting into this mythical magical
[00:27:36 --> 00:27:43]  life giving complexity like a bunch of swash buckling sailors and view it as a compartmentalized
[00:27:43 --> 00:27:48]  automobile that we can just take out a bearing here and a transmission here and put it on a spark plug
[00:27:48 --> 00:27:57]  there is is the height of hubris conquistador exploitative mentality that's where our food system
[00:27:57 --> 00:28:06]  is right now and so so yeah I think it's it's important to you know or Michael Pollin who
[00:28:06 --> 00:28:13]  and you know Michael Pollin who wrote the omnivores dilemma he he says that probably if you want
[00:28:13 --> 00:28:21]  to know what to eat we probably shouldn't eat anything that was um that's been created a food
[00:28:21 --> 00:28:27]  of food like substance has been created since 1900 that's kind of 1900's kind of the the cutoff
[00:28:27 --> 00:28:33]  point and of course you know the joke then is that we can all be thankful that hot dogs were introduced
[00:28:33 --> 00:28:38]  at the 1890 world's fair you know they hot dogs just slipped right under the right under the wire
[00:28:38 --> 00:28:43]  there but I I think there's a lot of truth in that you know 1900 I mean look if you if you can't
[00:28:43 --> 00:28:51]  if you can't make it in your kitchen and you can't you know you can't understand it then
[00:28:51 --> 00:28:59]  it probably shouldn't be eaten and you know we're the first we're the first culture in the world
[00:28:59 --> 00:29:05]  that ubiquitously consumes things that we can't pronounce and you can't make in your kitchen
[00:29:07 --> 00:29:13]  absolutely great and I love that framing of how nature is just such a complex
[00:29:13 --> 00:29:20]  beautiful beasts and there's again this continues to come up and all sorts of different subjects
[00:29:20 --> 00:29:26]  I dive into where humans are just fighting nature right now or we're trying to outsmart the
[00:29:26 --> 00:29:31]  world and all of his processes that are you know part of what makes it so wonderful and
[00:29:31 --> 00:29:38]  everything works so perfectly and has been for so long and we really just need to learn how to
[00:29:39 --> 00:29:47]  drop the ego as a species and just revert back to the way that things are supposed to work
[00:29:47 --> 00:29:53]  and this is you know what you're really big on regenerative farming which is using the new
[00:29:53 --> 00:29:59]  technology we have but using it in a way that works with nature and not trying to arm wrestle with it
[00:30:00 --> 00:30:06]  and I think that's so important because we do have some cool stuff we're able to you know do this
[00:30:06 --> 00:30:11]  this cool video call from across the world from each other that's awesome you know there's ways
[00:30:11 --> 00:30:17]  that we can use these technological benefits we have without completely blowing up these systems
[00:30:17 --> 00:30:22]  that are so important to life and nothing's more important than the food we put in our bodies and
[00:30:22 --> 00:30:28]  I think that that is I'm very excited and optimistic about the growing moving of people that are at
[00:30:28 --> 00:30:33]  asking questions about what they're eating and starting to like really think like what is actually
[00:30:33 --> 00:30:39]  healthy for me because for so long so many people have just sort of just shoveled everything and it
[00:30:39 --> 00:30:44]  pops up in front of them just we we've been sold this light at a calorie as a calorie doesn't matter
[00:30:44 --> 00:30:48]  you know what's actually in it you just just stuff everything in and you're getting your energy
[00:30:49 --> 00:30:54]  and this is just such a huge scam from all the different food industries of pharmaceutical industries
[00:30:54 --> 00:31:00]  are all just completely profit driven but I think this is a good time to sort of transition to the
[00:31:00 --> 00:31:05]  the different people out there that are trying to do their best food wise and a good example I know
[00:31:05 --> 00:31:10]  is the vegans you know pretty much all the vegans I grew up with in Seattle and know
[00:31:10 --> 00:31:16]  they are really trying their best to eat what they believe is healthy and do what they believe is
[00:31:16 --> 00:31:22]  best and do what they think is good for the planet and the animals as well they're not knowing
[00:31:22 --> 00:31:28]  you know doing these actops and so maybe I would like to ask you this question what do
[00:31:29 --> 00:31:35]  these these vegans and the people who are against you know animal protein maybe against like
[00:31:35 --> 00:31:40]  the farming that even you do what do they have correct and what do they have wrong?
[00:31:42 --> 00:31:51]  Well wow that's an interesting question I think what what they have right is that they care
[00:31:52 --> 00:32:00]  and so I'm giving a very congratulation you know salute to to intentionality to think about it
[00:32:00 --> 00:32:08]  I mean most most Americans eat unintentionally you know for convenience what's there there's no
[00:32:08 --> 00:32:15]  real intentionality and so eating intentionally is like that's the first step in solving a problem
[00:32:15 --> 00:32:22]  is to realizing oh well we've got a problem and that takes observational intentionality
[00:32:23 --> 00:32:34]  the the problem is that that we are not made to be vegans now I want to say this very carefully
[00:32:34 --> 00:32:45]  I have no problem with vegans in fact you know we have a lot of a lot of customers of our
[00:32:45 --> 00:32:53]  there there is a very minor group of people who who somewhat thrive under veganism
[00:32:53 --> 00:33:01]  clearly you know we have genetic we have genetic potential differences you know I mean that's why some
[00:33:01 --> 00:33:07]  some cultures can handle milk better than other cultures you know they've been century you know
[00:33:07 --> 00:33:13]  millennia in your background you know being able to handle milk so the fact is that we you know we are
[00:33:13 --> 00:33:20]  very very different and so you know there are some people who who do seem to do well on veganism
[00:33:20 --> 00:33:27]  but it's very very small you know less than 5% for sure less than 5% of the population
[00:33:28 --> 00:33:35]  it does well otherwise most people flourish better with some animal protein
[00:33:36 --> 00:33:40]  you know whether that's cheese eggs you know the the vegetarian approach
[00:33:41 --> 00:33:47]  whether it's pescaterians who eat fish and of course all the way through now we have an increasing
[00:33:47 --> 00:33:53]  number of people who are you know the paleo ketogenic carnivore you know name which you
[00:33:53 --> 00:34:02]  are yeah no vegetables forever two years feel amazing wow really how about that you look
[00:34:02 --> 00:34:10]  sick as a dog I don't I don't see how you can do that and so so the the truth is that human
[00:34:10 --> 00:34:18]  have been eating animals for a long time so I'm gonna divide this into two two thoughts one is
[00:34:18 --> 00:34:27]  the philosophical thought of well I don't want to kill something the the truth is that nothing can
[00:34:27 --> 00:34:33]  live without death I mean one of the best examples of that is a compost pile a compost pile
[00:34:33 --> 00:34:40]  is is stuff that was living that dies that gets eaten by other things that converts it to
[00:34:40 --> 00:34:45]  something that can make something else grow so you know if you don't think that if you don't think
[00:34:45 --> 00:34:50]  that everything is eating and being eaten go lie naked in your flower bed for you know three days
[00:34:50 --> 00:34:57]  to see what gets eaten trust me everything is eating and being eaten and so the very notion
[00:34:57 --> 00:35:06]  that we can that we can have life without death is is a fundamental ecological flaw the one
[00:35:06 --> 00:35:13]  of the most foundational environmental principles is that something has to die and be consumed
[00:35:14 --> 00:35:21]  and and then resurrected in a different life form in something that eats it I mean that's just that's
[00:35:21 --> 00:35:30]  just basic all right so you know obviously some vegans have called me a murderer you know
[00:35:30 --> 00:35:35]  well the fact is that we now know carrots talk to each other tomatoes talk to each other the
[00:35:35 --> 00:35:41]  the micro rizia talk to each other you know the language of the microbes you know the Stanford
[00:35:41 --> 00:35:46]  professor that's figured out the the language of these microbial communities I mean
[00:35:46 --> 00:35:53]  don't even start me on no no everything everything is sentient and understanding all right
[00:35:53 --> 00:36:00]  now if you say but but you know cows they they look they have eyes they look more like as well
[00:36:00 --> 00:36:07]  then then you're saying that that if if a being looks more like a human it's way more valuable than
[00:36:07 --> 00:36:14]  a being that doesn't look like a human and that's extremely um um answer for more physics so
[00:36:16 --> 00:36:23]  so let's let's let's let's just agree that everything everything consumes something else
[00:36:23 --> 00:36:28]  and something has to die that carrot has to die the beet has to die but tomato has to die
[00:36:29 --> 00:36:37]  you know in order for us to to eat and and they're all relationally complex and and communicating
[00:36:37 --> 00:36:45]  now let's go to the nutritional aspects so there are numerous especially the bee vitamins
[00:36:46 --> 00:36:53]  that you can't get in plants the plants just don't have it there's a you know it's a it's a
[00:36:53 --> 00:36:58]  relatively shortlist but a very important shortlist of things and for the vegans says well I just
[00:36:58 --> 00:37:04]  take supplements well you know do you really think that supplements is the way God set this up
[00:37:04 --> 00:37:12]  that you know that we would have to you know take a pill in order to complement so so for me
[00:37:13 --> 00:37:21]  kind of big picture I think it's important to understand that the fact that we can actually sit around
[00:37:21 --> 00:37:28]  and spend time spend time wrestling with whether or not we should eat meat
[00:37:29 --> 00:37:38]  is indicative not of a newly arrived you know evolution to some Nirvana spiritual plane
[00:37:38 --> 00:37:48]  but actually a profound devolution to a disconnection with our ecological umbilical you know
[00:37:48 --> 00:37:55]  our ancestors if you could shoot it trap it hatch it you live another day they didn't have time to
[00:37:55 --> 00:37:59]  sit around and decide you know should we eat a cow or should we drink a glass of milk
[00:38:00 --> 00:38:06]  they were literally in survival mode day to day to day and the reason all ancient civilizations
[00:38:06 --> 00:38:16]  the foundation of all their their their dietary intake was animal base whether it was dairy fish
[00:38:16 --> 00:38:23]  or or terrestrial meat the reason it was animal based is because that was the only thing that
[00:38:23 --> 00:38:33]  offered nutrient density without pillage that's why even um um um to um to for livestock so your
[00:38:33 --> 00:38:40]  chickens turkeys and pigs were kind of you know peripheral luxuries that that was the that was the
[00:38:40 --> 00:38:49]  the stuff that you know that was on the on the edges the mainstay was sheep goat cow
[00:38:50 --> 00:39:03]  camel water buffalo llama alpaca it was all herbivorous or seafood because it was the it was the
[00:39:03 --> 00:39:12]  herbivore and seafood that could be produced without growing grain without tillage and in the
[00:39:12 --> 00:39:18]  ancient you know societies tillage to grow grain was really laborious I mean if you have to walk
[00:39:18 --> 00:39:25]  all day with a sharp stick behind a you know an ox you couldn't till up very much and the
[00:39:25 --> 00:39:32]  the Native Americans here you know we have the three sisters garden you know the squash beans and corn
[00:39:32 --> 00:39:39]  maize but um that was not the mainstay that was that was a treat you know that was they
[00:39:39 --> 00:39:45]  parts that and kept it but the mainstay was vinesin and elk and bison and and and what they could
[00:39:45 --> 00:39:53]  you know fish then they could get a rivers um and and that was the mainstay of the diet and all that
[00:39:53 --> 00:39:59]  didn't require tillage it was hard to to turn up enough ground and get the vegetation cleaned
[00:39:59 --> 00:40:09]  off that you could actually grow an annual and so the whole idea of annuals is you know as a mainstay
[00:40:09 --> 00:40:16]  is completely anti-ecological nature tends toward perennials uh nobody's out there planting and
[00:40:16 --> 00:40:24]  tilling and harvesting nature tends toward perennials so our food system you know should
[00:40:24 --> 00:40:32]  tend toward perennials rather than annuals and of course herbivores especially cows sheep goats
[00:40:32 --> 00:40:38]  are the things that can eat perennials you and I can't we can't live on grass we can't live on
[00:40:38 --> 00:40:46]  chickery and golden rod and and you know grease grass uh sweet we can't live on that but an animal
[00:40:46 --> 00:40:51]  or an eruptial real quick just to make sure perennial just means it's like it sustains itself it
[00:40:51 --> 00:40:56]  continues like planting its own seeds through his process so we don't have to do anything essentially
[00:40:56 --> 00:41:03]  right yeah yeah it it it it it it uh it survives year to year in the root mass so so in the
[00:41:03 --> 00:41:10]  festival garden perennials would be like rhubarb a sparagus you know things that you don't have to plant
[00:41:11 --> 00:41:18]  but annuals are like squash watermelon green beans things that you have to plant every year and yeah
[00:41:18 --> 00:41:28]  thank you so the the ancient diets and and ecology is is foundationally a perennial ecology
[00:41:28 --> 00:41:31]  and then when you realize that the American farm bill
[00:41:33 --> 00:41:42]  subsidizes only six commodities all of which are annuals not perennials you realize how anti-acological
[00:41:42 --> 00:41:52]  the entire American farm policy is that it that it only ensures and and encourages and subsidizes
[00:41:53 --> 00:41:58]  annuals rather than you know perennials which is you know which is what nature tends toward
[00:41:58 --> 00:42:06]  so yeah so so the you know the vegan thing most people and and I've watched this over the years
[00:42:06 --> 00:42:14]  you know we've been in this a long time and we've had so many recovering vegans come
[00:42:14 --> 00:42:19]  and and I say this with a you know with a broken heart you know that they're they're
[00:42:19 --> 00:42:25]  joints because they don't have enough collagen and what they eat to keep their joints up
[00:42:26 --> 00:42:30]  women you know their their period stop there become unfurl
[00:42:30 --> 00:42:36]  because they don't have enough energy you know you get you get sunken eyes I mean we joke that you can
[00:42:36 --> 00:42:41]  always tell a vegan because they got sunken eyes and they got little arms they look like tyrannosaurus
[00:42:41 --> 00:42:49]  wrecks you know with a little you know they just don't have this robust flourishing appearance and so you know
[00:42:51 --> 00:42:56]  however you want to cut this from a philosophical standpoint there there's there's nothing there
[00:42:56 --> 00:43:00]  from a philosophical standpoint there's nothing there from an ecological standpoint and there's
[00:43:00 --> 00:43:05]  certainly nothing there from a nutritional standpoint I mean that's why in Italy Italy now
[00:43:05 --> 00:43:13]  they outlawed they outlawed vegan diets for children from like one to an or something like that
[00:43:14 --> 00:43:19]  it's illegal to have your child on a vegan diet until they're like 10 years old because
[00:43:19 --> 00:43:27]  the documentation you know your brain is fat your brain is fat and and and and if you don't get fat
[00:43:28 --> 00:43:33]  I don't mean you know get obese I mean if you don't ingest a certain amount of fat
[00:43:33 --> 00:43:39]  your brain simply doesn't develop I mean there's been some amazing studies in Africa for example
[00:43:39 --> 00:43:48]  where you know there's not enough animal and and what they're finding is as little as
[00:43:48 --> 00:43:57]  something like one egg a day one egg a day increases the IQ like 20 points I mean it just it's just
[00:43:57 --> 00:44:04]  off the charts so yeah we humans we are you know our eyes are in the front of our head you know
[00:44:04 --> 00:44:12]  we're we're made we are we are hunters by you know by nature and so you know a cow the eyes are
[00:44:12 --> 00:44:18]  in the side of our head you know so she can see out for predators we're the you know we're the
[00:44:18 --> 00:44:30]  you know the the the you know Keystone you know Keystone predator and and so we need we need to exercise that role
[00:44:32 --> 00:44:38]  yeah beautifully said it and I've had several ex-vegans on this podcast as well just telling their story
[00:44:38 --> 00:44:48]  specifically the ones that go all the way to carnivore and this is one of the interesting things that I've found
[00:44:48 --> 00:44:53]  arriving at the carnivore diet then someone just eating the standard American diet because they are
[00:44:53 --> 00:44:57]  like you said they're being intentional they're trying to flex route and they just got they
[00:44:57 --> 00:45:03]  they've got juke by a few Netflix documentaries to go the wrong direction and then once you know enough
[00:45:04 --> 00:45:08]  information and personal experiences they will to break through that shell that they built then
[00:45:08 --> 00:45:13]  they realize oh this is actually like the best way to work with nature this is the way that nature
[00:45:13 --> 00:45:20]  design me and I'm not being evil for eating what I'm supposed to eat you know we shouldn't we shouldn't
[00:45:20 --> 00:45:24]  insult the lion for going to eat that animal that's just what nature does and we need to be part
[00:45:24 --> 00:45:29]  of nature as well and I really like that pattern of more people starting to open their minds and look
[00:45:29 --> 00:45:35]  at this we have a lot of work to do of course but it is promising for sure and I would throw a
[00:45:35 --> 00:45:40]  couple other things in there that I I'm sure you will have some some words on one thing that they
[00:45:40 --> 00:45:46]  write one thing they have wrong I think we could quickly touch on here one of the things that they have
[00:45:46 --> 00:45:51]  wrong is there's good for the environment we talked about the health part but for the environmental part
[00:45:51 --> 00:45:58]  the the model crop and it is required to scale their agriculture that they have in mind could
[00:45:58 --> 00:46:06]  could you give us a quick just run down on this what is model cropping like how how how this
[00:46:06 --> 00:46:11]  required form of like mass fruit and vegetable production is the worst thing for the environment
[00:46:13 --> 00:46:22]  yeah well well that's that's a great one and I would I was going to kind of interrupt and say I want
[00:46:22 --> 00:46:27]  to talk about the environment with cows even if you didn't bring it up so you brought it up so now
[00:46:27 --> 00:46:33]  I've got a nice segue to talk about you know cows and you know burping and farting cows you know
[00:46:33 --> 00:46:40]  are they are they going to turn us all into crispy critters in you know 40 years and so I think I think
[00:46:40 --> 00:46:48]  as a starting point I'd like to just point out that the you know movies like cow spuracy like
[00:46:48 --> 00:46:55]  um what the health you know these kinds of things and they're dangerous yes game changers all of the
[00:46:56 --> 00:47:04]  data points in research is based on feed lots on on chemical oriented hormone
[00:47:06 --> 00:47:13]  vaccinated feed lot type production and my point is they're not coming here to our farm to get
[00:47:13 --> 00:47:21]  data points but what happens is when you go to a a natural pattern regenerative ag whatever you want
[00:47:21 --> 00:47:30]  call it ecological farming when you go to following nature's template in this what happens is
[00:47:31 --> 00:47:36]  that all those the cycles begin to close for it let me give you an example
[00:47:37 --> 00:47:41]  methaneatrophic bacteria let me say at one more time sir everybody gets it's a big word
[00:47:42 --> 00:47:48]  methaneatrophic bacteria now the first part of that is methane methaneatrophic bacteria all right
[00:47:48 --> 00:47:55]  it it is it is a free living bacteria in the soil it only lives under perennial
[00:47:55 --> 00:48:03]  pastures it doesn't live under corn it doesn't live under parking lots it doesn't live in your yard okay
[00:48:03 --> 00:48:13]  it lives where there is a diversified perennial pasture and and under those conditions
[00:48:14 --> 00:48:22]  there's enough methaneatrophic bacteria in the soil to bring down and metabolize the methane
[00:48:22 --> 00:48:32]  from a thousand cows per acre now nobody's going to put a thousand cows per acre but that's that's
[00:48:32 --> 00:48:41]  how much wiggle room how much protection there is in nature in the system to make sure that there's
[00:48:41 --> 00:48:52]  waste that everything gets completely you know recycled and you know and hand but these these
[00:48:52 --> 00:48:58]  movies these documentaries they don't talk about that they don't talk about anything of the
[00:48:58 --> 00:49:05]  positive nature they don't talk about when people say what what cows are inefficient well yeah
[00:49:05 --> 00:49:10]  they're inefficient that's why they build soil you know the great the soils on the the deepest best
[00:49:10 --> 00:49:17]  oils on the planet are not under trees they're not under bushes they're certainly not under you
[00:49:17 --> 00:49:27]  know under crops they're under perennial prairies why because herbivores only take a little bit of
[00:49:27 --> 00:49:35]  what they ingest most of it is recycled in manure and urine and and they actually are dumping back
[00:49:35 --> 00:49:41]  a lot more I mean the here's the deal if everything was efficient was as efficient as a squash or a
[00:49:41 --> 00:49:53]  green bean we would not have any soil on the planet so so so efficiency in terms of you know
[00:49:53 --> 00:49:59]  like ounce of something per acre is not a measure unless you look a hundred years down the road
[00:49:59 --> 00:50:05]  to say what does that acre look like after it's produced all this you know for a hundred years
[00:50:05 --> 00:50:13]  and under under cropping under annuals right now every bushel of corn in America every bushel of
[00:50:13 --> 00:50:22]  corn cost us two bushels of soil it's that it's that exploitive and the same can be true for a lot
[00:50:22 --> 00:50:28]  of other things sugar beats and and all the other inputs so when you know impossible burger beyond
[00:50:28 --> 00:50:35]  meats and all this you know vegan stuff that people say oh you know this is so much more ecological
[00:50:35 --> 00:50:45]  actually it is way less ecological because it requires a lot of chemicals tillage tractor work
[00:50:45 --> 00:50:53]  all this stuff and it's a monocryp and it sterilizes the soil rather than increasing the diversity
[00:50:53 --> 00:51:00]  of the soil and so the whole thing is a is a is a fraud uh foisted upon people
[00:51:00 --> 00:51:08]  from a from an ecological and certainly a nutritional standpoint but when we when we raise
[00:51:08 --> 00:51:15]  especially herbivores cows or herbivores in the right pattern if you look at them if you look at
[00:51:15 --> 00:51:21]  the way herbivores have been raised you know throughout nature you know right now the biggest
[00:51:21 --> 00:51:25]  urge or the will to be some the serendent yet in Africa those are the last you know remaining large
[00:51:25 --> 00:51:33]  urge but you know if you look at the the bison the caraboo the moose the will to be some you know
[00:51:33 --> 00:51:42]  the big the the the the uh our rocks you know back in prehistoric Europe what you what you find is
[00:51:43 --> 00:51:49]  that the herbivores do three things they they they they move they don't stand the same place
[00:51:49 --> 00:51:55]  their um their mobbed up for predator protection they're not scattered all out over and then
[00:51:55 --> 00:52:01]  they're mowing you know they're not nobody's bringing them up a silice they're not eating corn
[00:52:01 --> 00:52:07]  they're mowing they're mowing forages okay they're they're pruners so they're moving mowing
[00:52:08 --> 00:52:18]  when you when you adapt all those and and and and utilize them on your own you know domestic
[00:52:18 --> 00:52:26]  production just like in nature they become the most wonderful soil building ecological asset
[00:52:26 --> 00:52:34]  but if you violate any of those three ms moving mobbing mowing if you violate any of them you turn
[00:52:34 --> 00:52:40]  that wonderful asset into a liability and ninety and the truth is ninety five percent of domestic
[00:52:40 --> 00:52:47]  livestock in the world violates at least one if not two and some all three of those of those natural
[00:52:48 --> 00:52:57]  so my indictment of the of the documentaries that send people into a dither on this my indictment
[00:52:57 --> 00:53:06]  of them is that they are not they you can't study what isn't and and I know we exist but but
[00:53:06 --> 00:53:13]  in the big scheme of things in their view we don't exist we're too small you know the the little you
[00:53:13 --> 00:53:20]  regenerative ag uh uh little of people were you know whatever 2 percent okay and so you know when
[00:53:20 --> 00:53:24]  you're going to study something you tend to study the easy group you know the big group I mean
[00:53:24 --> 00:53:32]  that's where you get your statistical importance and so when you when you study when your data base
[00:53:32 --> 00:53:41]  comes from a flawed model then where you end up extrapolating from that is a completely flawed
[00:53:42 --> 00:53:49]  conclusion if all your data points are from a flawed production a model and that's that's actually
[00:53:49 --> 00:53:58]  where we are and so the the the beauty of this the the I guess the bottom line for me is looking back
[00:53:58 --> 00:54:07]  that North America North America produced more food 500 years ago than it does today
[00:54:08 --> 00:54:14]  now it wasn't all eaten by people you know we had we had you know a couple hundred million
[00:54:14 --> 00:54:20]  bison we had two million wolves that needed forty twenty pounds of meat a day that's forty
[00:54:20 --> 00:54:26]  million pounds pounds of meat just to feed wolves of course we had you know deer elk we had two
[00:54:26 --> 00:54:31]  hundred million beavers that ate more vegetables you know they're they're herbivores we had two
[00:54:31 --> 00:54:38]  million beavers that ate more food than all the humans in North America today we had birds you know
[00:54:38 --> 00:54:43]  oughta been set under a tree in the early 1800s in a record he said I haven't seen the sun for three
[00:54:43 --> 00:54:51]  days because the flock of passenger pigeons was so tight and big I couldn't see the they flew
[00:54:51 --> 00:54:55]  over I couldn't see the sun for three days you know as anybody seen a flock of birds go over
[00:54:55 --> 00:55:00]  that blocked out the sun for three days I don't think so and that's before Tyson and Purdue
[00:55:00 --> 00:55:08]  and programs pride and and and John Deer and all that and so so the fact is that the the native
[00:55:08 --> 00:55:14]  Americans actually using fire and their own hunting and their own movement and then the the the
[00:55:14 --> 00:55:24]  the predator prey relationships that we had at that time it was extremely productive and should
[00:55:24 --> 00:55:29]  give us all pause today when we realized we actually produced more food 500 years ago
[00:55:29 --> 00:55:38]  then we do today even with all these fancy technologies and you know distribution methods and
[00:55:38 --> 00:55:44]  supply chains that we are told I think we're sort of just suddenly fed this lie that everything
[00:55:44 --> 00:55:49]  is working so much better now because we have all this technology when really when you dive into it
[00:55:49 --> 00:55:54]  obviously our health is not doing better and like you said that the output isn't even better so
[00:55:54 --> 00:55:59]  yeah we really need to just completely start from scratch on this and just look at from a blank slate
[00:56:00 --> 00:56:05]  I love how you you sort of brought this into the factory farming because when I was going
[00:56:05 --> 00:56:09]  earlier when I I mentioned what I was going to say one thing that I thought because had a right
[00:56:09 --> 00:56:13]  one thing that had wrong the thing I was going to say that they have a right is that factory
[00:56:13 --> 00:56:19]  farming is absolutely terrible and I know that you completely grew that as well and I think this
[00:56:19 --> 00:56:26]  would be a good time to pivot over to the solution I don't think we need to like explain too much
[00:56:26 --> 00:56:31]  well maybe you can about why it's just absolutely horrible to be stopping these animals in these
[00:56:31 --> 00:56:39]  tight spaces where they're just breathing their own feces and just in a horrific condition where they
[00:56:39 --> 00:56:43]  are being you know jabs with all these vaccines all these completely unnatural things are going on
[00:56:44 --> 00:56:51]  so maybe you sort of touched on it there but maybe you could quickly touch on you know why this
[00:56:51 --> 00:56:56]  is terrible and really you know just lay that to us because we know that this is about we need to
[00:56:56 --> 00:57:01]  find a solution and then we can pivot into the solution that you do so much we're talking about
[00:57:01 --> 00:57:07]  which is regenerative farming or a regenerative agriculture and how that fits this mess yeah sure
[00:57:07 --> 00:57:14]  well great so so you know if you and I if Ben if you and I were appointed a committee
[00:57:14 --> 00:57:21]  a diabolical committee you know think about the the bad guy in you know in james bought
[00:57:21 --> 00:57:28]  in movies all right you know this conspirator and we were we were a named on a committee to figure out
[00:57:28 --> 00:57:35]  how to make a pathogenic farm we want farms that are incredibly toxic and pathogenic
[00:57:36 --> 00:57:42]  all right so so we're going to sit together and we're going to conceive of a plan well the first thing
[00:57:42 --> 00:57:49]  we want to do is we want to grow only one thing we don't want to grow a diversified farm we just want
[00:57:49 --> 00:57:54]  one thing so the pathogens and all that you know they've always got a host there and they can
[00:57:54 --> 00:57:58]  proliferate because there's always a host there all right next thing we're going to do is we're going to
[00:57:58 --> 00:58:03]  it's it once we pick the one thing we're going to raise we're going to put it as close together as
[00:58:03 --> 00:58:08]  possible so that so that the pathogens don't have to go you know try to find a host that there's
[00:58:08 --> 00:58:12]  one right here you know there there are all the place you know we can we can make babies and have
[00:58:12 --> 00:58:21]  proliferate and you know and all sorts of things going on so we would we would put them real close together
[00:58:21 --> 00:58:29]  the next thing we would do is is we would deny them fresh air you know there's no reason to have
[00:58:29 --> 00:58:34]  fresh air let's let's have them breathe in fecal particulate you know that would be wonderful
[00:58:34 --> 00:58:40]  fecal particulate you know we're going to let them breathe in fecal particulate and then we're
[00:58:40 --> 00:58:44]  we're not going to let them we're not going to let them have sunshine sunshine that's the sanitizer
[00:58:44 --> 00:58:49]  and we don't want sun we're going to put them in a building and make sure they can't have sanitary
[00:58:50 --> 00:58:59]  and then okay so we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll make sure they can't get much exercise exercise
[00:58:59 --> 00:59:05]  is a healthy yeah we don't want them to have exercise okay so I don't mean to belabor the point but
[00:59:05 --> 00:59:10]  as I've gone through this the point is what I've just described I've just described
[00:59:11 --> 00:59:19]  factory farming and so if we wanted to you you couldn't if you wanted to create
[00:59:19 --> 00:59:28]  on purpose a diabolically pathogenic farming system you could not create conceived build
[00:59:29 --> 00:59:38]  a more effective system than factory farming that's where we are and and of course you know
[00:59:38 --> 00:59:44]  the industry is trying to mask the the health problems in that you know with everything from
[00:59:46 --> 00:59:55]  you know vaccines to medications all sorts of things and and let me just say one more thing
[00:59:55 --> 01:00:04]  we've learned from the chefs all of our chefs that we supply is that that all of our
[01:00:04 --> 01:00:09]  meats are our poultry and beef and pork and all this stuff it cooks about 15 to 20% faster
[01:00:09 --> 01:00:14]  than store bought that then the conventional stuff cooks faster so we've been slew
[01:00:14 --> 01:00:20]  thing at this for a long time why why why and the only thing we've been able to actually come up
[01:00:20 --> 01:00:29]  with is that these diabolical systems are so stressful on the animal they're they're immunostressful
[01:00:29 --> 01:00:35]  they're socially stressful they're emotionally stressful they're habitat stressful okay
[01:00:35 --> 01:00:41]  they're so stressful that the animal what happens when you're under stress you secret adrenaline
[01:00:41 --> 01:00:46]  you know I mean the the epitome of that is the the hundred pound mom that picks the car up off
[01:00:46 --> 01:00:51]  the toddler okay well what happens your muscles tighten up right that that's what the adrenaline
[01:00:51 --> 01:00:55]  heightens up your muscles and you're able to do this you know superhuman stuff and run
[01:00:55 --> 01:01:00]  marathon all this stuff because you're you're taunting and taught and your muscles are say it's adrenaline
[01:01:00 --> 01:01:06]  all right which is good if you're trying to run away from a lion you know adrenaline was really good
[01:01:06 --> 01:01:11]  I can run faster you know with this adrenaline the problem is it tightens everything up
[01:01:12 --> 01:01:19]  and so what we've been able to kind of deduce is that since our animals are never stressed they're
[01:01:19 --> 01:01:26]  always happy they never secret adrenaline and this brings them to the table relaxed and comfortable
[01:01:27 --> 01:01:34]  and so I I dare to ask the question this it's a little bit woo woo but I dare to ask the question
[01:01:34 --> 01:01:44]  can we eat happiness or can we eat abuse and I would suggest you know we say you are what you eat
[01:01:44 --> 01:01:50]  well you know if what we're eating lives a life of stress and abuse and disrespect
[01:01:52 --> 01:01:58]  does that translate is there any translation they're into us compared to an animal that's
[01:01:58 --> 01:02:04]  a happy comfortable respectful life you know respecting the thickness of the pig the chickenest of the chicken
[01:02:06 --> 01:02:13]  and you know no listen nobody in industrial agriculture is running in x to my knowledge
[01:02:13 --> 01:02:19]  is running an experiment anywhere in any of our land grant universities which should all be
[01:02:19 --> 01:02:24]  defunded and shut down the government should government shouldn't be you know subsidizing education
[01:02:24 --> 01:02:32]  that's another little side note but but nobody in any of these institutions is doing research
[01:02:32 --> 01:02:41]  on the benefits of happy pigs the only question is can we grow them faster,
[01:02:41 --> 01:02:47]  fatter, bigger cheaper that's the only question nobody's asking about happiness and I would suggest
[01:02:47 --> 01:02:53]  that if that became the the foundational question of all of our research
[01:02:54 --> 01:03:01]  maybe we would start growing healthier animals healthier food and we would actually have
[01:03:01 --> 01:03:06]  happier healthier people as a result of figuring out how to grow happier healthier plants and animals
[01:03:08 --> 01:03:14]  absolutely agree and the the way that Jacob Wookie put it and he's another regenerative
[01:03:14 --> 01:03:20]  farmer that I talked to from Australia how these animals that you are raising regeneratively
[01:03:20 --> 01:03:27]  and we'll go into what exactly that is in a second but they are living amazing lives and the
[01:03:27 --> 01:03:33]  way he put it was they have one bad day you know these have they have just a wonderful fun life
[01:03:33 --> 01:03:37]  and you can dive into like exactly why that is but they're doing exactly what they want to be doing
[01:03:37 --> 01:03:42]  for their entire life until the very day they're harvested and there's no stress there you know
[01:03:42 --> 01:03:47]  couldn't ask for a better life as an animal like even animals that are out in the wild are
[01:03:47 --> 01:03:53]  having more stress and harder time because they have to constantly worry about getting killed and
[01:03:54 --> 01:04:00]  you are basically like we said earlier working with nature to to give them like a completely
[01:04:00 --> 01:04:05]  natural life that they love without those stressors so you're actually working with nature in a way
[01:04:05 --> 01:04:10]  that that makes everything happier so you have healthier animals happier animals and eventually
[01:04:10 --> 01:04:17]  when that natural process of life does occur when we harvest those animals to become our food and
[01:04:18 --> 01:04:24]  there everything works perfectly it's seamless and so maybe we can talk we brought this
[01:04:24 --> 01:04:27]  out a couple of times like the regenerative for a miracle. Could you give us like a regenerative
[01:04:27 --> 01:04:34]  agriculture 101 what exactly it is how it's a enormous contrast from that factory farming.
[01:04:34 --> 01:04:41]  Yeah I mean there's a couple of things that I would just point out one is it should be building soil
[01:04:41 --> 01:04:47]  not reducing soil I mean that's that's that's critical I would suggest that it should be something
[01:04:47 --> 01:04:53]  that's attractive to the next generation a lot of people don't talk about that but I think I think
[01:04:53 --> 01:05:00]  in general a farm that's not generating a salary for two generations I mean
[01:05:01 --> 01:05:07]  that has two generations working in it doesn't have a valid successful
[01:05:07 --> 01:05:13]  a successful plan and therefore it's not sustainable so if you're going to have a sustainable
[01:05:13 --> 01:05:21]  business you got to have you got to have that that that that new generation capacity into it so
[01:05:21 --> 01:05:30]  you know is it economically and emotionally and ecologically viable that a young person once
[01:05:30 --> 01:05:39]  wants to go into it and and you know that's a that's a big issue another one is simply
[01:05:40 --> 01:05:51]  how dependent is it on you know on far-flung inputs for example when hoot and invaded Ukraine
[01:05:51 --> 01:05:59]  and fertilizer jump 400 percent because turns out that rush is one of the U.S. as
[01:05:59 --> 01:06:10]  largest chemical fertilizer suppliers ear on our farm we just laughed because we don't buy any of it
[01:06:10 --> 01:06:18]  you know we we were immune to that and so we were not entangled we were not dependent on you know
[01:06:18 --> 01:06:24]  somewhat far-flung outfits in the nefarious agenda and so you know you've got you've got soil building
[01:06:24 --> 01:06:35]  I would say in general you know attractiveness to the next generation and then and then
[01:06:37 --> 01:06:44]  more on site you know on site cycling as opposed to I mean no man's an island so there's oh
[01:06:44 --> 01:06:51]  you know you're always dependent on somebody else for some some things but but less less is better
[01:06:51 --> 01:06:57]  and perhaps the last another one if you want a fourth one would be you know what's it
[01:06:57 --> 01:07:05]  what's it doing to the species diversity on site we just worked with a Smithsonian study a few
[01:07:05 --> 01:07:13]  years ago and they had 29 sites in Virginia I think we were the only ones that they found all
[01:07:14 --> 01:07:21]  all known eight eight known species of bumblebees in the state and that was kind of cool
[01:07:21 --> 01:07:26]  and I think it's because there's always something pollinating here because we have so much
[01:07:26 --> 01:07:30]  you know plant diversity in the way we move the cows around the fields there's always something
[01:07:30 --> 01:07:36]  you know pollinating and so that that stimulates that's thing relates a lot a lot of diversity
[01:07:36 --> 01:07:42]  and pollinators are a little bit of you know the canary in the mind as pollinators goes so goes the
[01:07:42 --> 01:07:50]  ecology so could you walk me through just for the total beginner what someone will see when they
[01:07:50 --> 01:07:56]  actually step foot on your farm and start walking around to look at things so you know what are
[01:07:56 --> 01:08:02]  the animals doing what's the process that you take them through to mimic nature that we're talking
[01:08:02 --> 01:08:10]  about here yeah so the first thing you'll first thing you'll notice is there's no smell that's
[01:08:10 --> 01:08:15]  one of the first things anybody ever says that there's no smell and you know no bad smell I mean
[01:08:15 --> 01:08:21]  yeah there are smells but they're good smells and you know our our position is as far
[01:08:21 --> 01:08:28]  as not aromatically and aesthetically essentially romantic it's probably not good farming so
[01:08:28 --> 01:08:33]  so that's the first you know there's no smell so when you when you come in you'll notice
[01:08:33 --> 01:08:38]  the cattle you know cows are on pasture but they're but they're confined to a little tiny spot
[01:08:38 --> 01:08:44]  you know there might be a hundred on on one acre all right confined with electric fence so we
[01:08:44 --> 01:08:52]  move them every single day we move them to a new a new paddock so that they're moving mobbing and
[01:08:52 --> 01:08:58]  mowing and you'll notice that the grass that they're eating is long it's not short it's not
[01:08:58 --> 01:09:05]  overgrazed like you'll see coming in here because we are we are resting and only allowing
[01:09:05 --> 01:09:11]  the cattle to get to the grass when it has regrown to what we call energy equilibrium
[01:09:11 --> 01:09:16]  then if you look a little bit about three or four days behind the cows you'll see an egg mobile
[01:09:16 --> 01:09:21]  and you'll see chickens spread out across the field and the chickens are scratching through
[01:09:21 --> 01:09:29]  the three to four-day old compa manure piles manure pads and eating the fly larva out
[01:09:29 --> 01:09:35]  as a pasture sanitizer behind the cows eating out whatever parasites grew you know a
[01:09:35 --> 01:09:39]  parasites grubs and things like that eating the grass hoppers and crickets that are newly exposed
[01:09:39 --> 01:09:45]  because the cows just ate off the vegetation and so the the the the egg mobiles are portable
[01:09:45 --> 01:09:53]  chicken houses that the you know that the birds you know run in and then you'll see over here also
[01:09:53 --> 01:10:00]  maybe in the same field you'll see broiler shelters so these are 10 foot by 12 foot by two foot high
[01:10:01 --> 01:10:10]  little you know rectangular shelters no floor no floor and we moved them they've got chickens
[01:10:10 --> 01:10:16]  and meat chickens broilers and we moved them every single day every single morning at daybreak
[01:10:16 --> 01:10:21]  we moved them another spot across the field and they look like a bunch of you know migrating birds
[01:10:21 --> 01:10:28]  in a kind of a you know a flared V formation coming across the field they get a fresh spot every
[01:10:28 --> 01:10:34]  single day and so with our little dolly in our system you know one person without starting an engine
[01:10:34 --> 01:10:41]  can move a 4,500 of these chickens in one hour and the and the shelters protect them from weather
[01:10:41 --> 01:10:48]  from predation and all that and gives them a completely new salad bar fresh air sunshine
[01:10:48 --> 01:10:55]  green material they're betting it's changed every day the pigs depending on what time of year you come
[01:10:55 --> 01:11:03]  the pigs might be the pigs might be pigurating so in the winter when we run out of grass and
[01:11:03 --> 01:11:10]  there's snow on the ground we have the cows under a shed awning that protects the manure and
[01:11:10 --> 01:11:17]  urine from winter rain and leaching and we use a carbonaceous diaper so nothing you'll see
[01:11:17 --> 01:11:23]  as a carbon shed full of wood chips and we have a big industrial wood shipper that we work with
[01:11:23 --> 01:11:30]  in the woods and and bring down wood chips and the chips become a carbonaceous diaper to absorb
[01:11:30 --> 01:11:36]  the manure and urine from the cattle dropping in the winter time we add corn to it they mix all
[01:11:36 --> 01:11:42]  the corn into it the corn firmants because it's anaerobic they're heavy dropping out the oxygen
[01:11:43 --> 01:11:48]  and you know this firm in the corn and then the pigs for you know about two months in the spring
[01:11:48 --> 01:11:53]  the pigs are in that betting pack which might grow up that carbonaceous diaper it might be
[01:11:53 --> 01:11:59]  you know three or four feet deep even put the pigs in the pigs seek the firm in corn and in doing
[01:11:59 --> 01:12:05]  so they rotate it like you know like a big rotivator and convert it from anaerobic to aerobic
[01:12:05 --> 01:12:11]  compost with pigs paying the I mean with corn paying the pigs salary and the pigs are great
[01:12:11 --> 01:12:18]  work the show all the time every day they never complain they're always happy and I don't have
[01:12:18 --> 01:12:24]  to steer them anywhere I don't have to give them a work schedule they all know what to do and you
[01:12:24 --> 01:12:30]  know so it works really great and so the pigs now build that all that compost when they're done
[01:12:30 --> 01:12:37]  they go out into pig silvo pastures we have a bunch of these out where we put groups of 35 to 50
[01:12:37 --> 01:12:42]  pigs in a group move them every five to 12 days through these silvo pastures that silvo pasture
[01:12:42 --> 01:12:48]  is like a park it's widely spaced trees with grass underneath and of course you know we give them
[01:12:48 --> 01:12:55]  feed as well GMO free feed and so they get the salad bar and they get their you know their
[01:12:55 --> 01:13:01]  cafeteria feed through so those are just some of the things you'll see of course we've got
[01:13:01 --> 01:13:06]  we've got sheep they they're in electric wire too and they're moved around every day
[01:13:06 --> 01:13:13]  turkeys you know turkeys are moved around every day and in a netting got the millennium
[01:13:13 --> 01:13:22]  feather net the millennium feather net is a is a a frame style on on skids with a thousand layers in it
[01:13:22 --> 01:13:27]  with electrified netting surrounding them we move them you know every couple of days along the
[01:13:27 --> 01:13:33]  pasture so you know what you'll see is there's a lot of animals there's no smell there's no flies
[01:13:33 --> 01:13:39]  but everything is movable it's all mobile it's portable moving around the pastures and
[01:13:39 --> 01:13:47]  yeah it's quite it's quite beautiful actually it sounds like it and I just want to come see it someday
[01:13:47 --> 01:13:51]  I want to come check it out because I could just imagine all these contraptions moving around
[01:13:51 --> 01:13:56]  it's just a beautiful sight and all well and like we said earlier this is it's mimicking nature
[01:13:56 --> 01:14:02]  it's really working with nature allowing them to continue moving to different spots all the time just
[01:14:02 --> 01:14:07]  they would way back in a day you know when they're just grazing and sort of moving across the land
[01:14:07 --> 01:14:13]  and I think that's so cool it work and someone go to like learn about those parts specifically like
[01:14:13 --> 01:14:18]  I don't know if those contraptions are you know things that be other people could like make
[01:14:18 --> 01:14:26]  themselves or they're absolutely we have a we have a big heavy thick book at ways five pounds
[01:14:26 --> 01:14:31]  and it's the blueprint it's the it's the building designs is called polyface designs
[01:14:32 --> 01:14:37]  polyface designs and it has all this mobile infrastructure and that you can get that
[01:14:37 --> 01:14:41]  and if you don't want to read it it's five pounds so you can use it for weightlifting if you
[01:14:41 --> 01:14:46]  you know if you don't want to read it but yeah it's a you know big thick heavy heavy book
[01:14:47 --> 01:14:51]  yeah all this stuff is detailed in there you know and and a lot of people you know they always
[01:14:51 --> 01:14:57]  ask me well yeah this is really creative you know how did you come up with this well you come up with it
[01:14:57 --> 01:15:03]  when you study nature and you have very simple phrases like for example in nature animals move
[01:15:04 --> 01:15:09]  I mean that's such a simple phrase animals move they're not stationary they're not pinned up they move
[01:15:09 --> 01:15:17]  well as soon as you say oh oh okay so animals move all right as soon as you say that phrase
[01:15:17 --> 01:15:23]  well now you need to control them somehow you need to get them water somehow you need to get them
[01:15:23 --> 01:15:33]  feed you need to get them shelter and so so that simple phrase animals move you know springboards
[01:15:33 --> 01:15:39]  you into all this other stuff so it's not like we sat around here one day in a you know in a yoga
[01:15:39 --> 01:15:47]  focus group position saying you know how can be we weird or how can we be innovative it's actually
[01:15:47 --> 01:15:53]  just we sat around and said well how does nature work well animals move all right and then so then
[01:15:53 --> 01:15:59]  how you know how do we handle it how how how does soil get built it doesn't get built was 101010
[01:15:59 --> 01:16:05]  came off fertilizer oh it gets built with carbon so how do we increase carbon so now we're composing
[01:16:05 --> 01:16:13]  the carbonation stiper perineals movement you know and so they're really very very simple questions
[01:16:13 --> 01:16:21]  with profound ramifications when you start looking at nature as template rather than nature as
[01:16:21 --> 01:16:32]  something to be either adulterated disrespected or you know or abused absolutely yeah and uh
[01:16:32 --> 01:16:37]  Joel I know you have a very busy schedule you got about 15 minutes left here so I think this would be
[01:16:37 --> 01:16:44]  excellent time for for one last question for people which I would say probably the majority out there
[01:16:44 --> 01:16:49]  who are hearing this and taking this sounds so cool I want to participate I want to become part of
[01:16:49 --> 01:16:55]  this but I don't have a farm or you know I don't have the time to like you know build all these
[01:16:55 --> 01:17:00]  contraptions or really like do the deep dive into the large scale regenerative agriculture I know
[01:17:00 --> 01:17:07]  that you were also a very big proponent of people taking important steps on a micro level and I
[01:17:07 --> 01:17:11]  can use my parent's example here my mom and dad are actually building a new property
[01:17:12 --> 01:17:17]  and they are going to have a garden they're going to have some space some grass some trees and
[01:17:17 --> 01:17:23]  I would love for you to just give your sort of one-on-one on what people can start doing now
[01:17:23 --> 01:17:27]  I know one of the things you always talk about everyone should have chickens so maybe that could be
[01:17:27 --> 01:17:31]  sort of the kick-off but what do you think the people out there who have just a little bit of
[01:17:31 --> 01:17:35]  laying and want to get their feet wet should should do what's their their starter guide
[01:17:35 --> 01:17:40]  yeah so I've got that's that's a really good question I've got to kind of a
[01:17:40 --> 01:17:47]  a three ingredient recipe as an answer to that question so I got three things number one get in your kitchen
[01:17:48 --> 01:17:57]  we we cannot have an authentic food system until we re-discover domestic culinary arts
[01:17:58 --> 01:18:03]  and I'm not talking about grandma's kitchen you know having to go to a spring with a wooden bucket
[01:18:03 --> 01:18:09]  to fetch water I mean we you think about our modern kitchens we've got every techno glitzies
[01:18:09 --> 01:18:15]  sophisticated thing we've got insta pots bread makers ice cream makers you know kitchen aid
[01:18:15 --> 01:18:21]  a hot and cold running water refrigerators I mean a hot crock pots good grief you know we've got
[01:18:21 --> 01:18:29]  everything today so so cooking from scratch has never been easier it's never been easier
[01:18:29 --> 01:18:34]  and so we need to leverage that we can't we can't abdicate
[01:18:35 --> 01:18:41]  food participation as profoundly as we have and expect integrity
[01:18:42 --> 01:18:47]  provenance you can't you have to you have to feel the chicken you got to you know you got to get in there you
[01:18:47 --> 01:18:53]  got to you know uh get in there and do it so number one get your kitchen number two do something
[01:18:53 --> 01:19:00]  yourself even if it's just a quart jar of sprouted mung beans on the wind to seal or a little um
[01:19:00 --> 01:19:07]  you know uh worm uh worm a composting kit you know under the kitchen sink uh or a hanging little
[01:19:07 --> 01:19:14]  herbal you know PVC patio garden uh in my book polyface micro I have how to have rabbits and chickens
[01:19:14 --> 01:19:21]  on a man hat and apartment uh on on a footprint that's no bigger than a lazy boy or recliner okay
[01:19:22 --> 01:19:28]  so yeah chickens are definitely my my animal of choice on small spaces because they can take your kitchen
[01:19:28 --> 01:19:36]  scraps and turn them into eggs they're also a great a teenager's um a great role you know role model
[01:19:36 --> 01:19:41]  for teenagers chickens are the first animals up in the morning they wake up as soon as it's light
[01:19:41 --> 01:19:46]  and they spend all day turning trash into treasure and as soon as the sun starts to go down
[01:19:46 --> 01:19:52]  they go up and they go to bed I mean that's a great role model for teenagers you know uh happy
[01:19:52 --> 01:19:57]  in the morning working all day happily you know and then I go to bed as soon as it gets dark um so
[01:19:57 --> 01:20:03]  do something yourself just just just to just to just to just to participate in the mystery the
[01:20:03 --> 01:20:11]  majesty of of life the number three number three then is to connect to your own provenance
[01:20:11 --> 01:20:17]  you know you can you can you can turn off your Netflix and take a little bit of invest some time and
[01:20:17 --> 01:20:24]  energy in in connecting to your provenance whether it's on a website uh whether it's going out
[01:20:24 --> 01:20:30]  and visiting some farms uh you know going to farmers market whatever but but but but connect to some
[01:20:30 --> 01:20:35]  provenance and if I may make a shameless ad here if you're completely stymetting you don't know
[01:20:35 --> 01:20:41]  where to start you can start by placing an order with us we ship nationwide every week and
[01:20:41 --> 01:20:48]  if you you know if this sounds too good to be true let us send you some uh let us send you some
[01:20:48 --> 01:20:55]  some food and uh and you'll quickly find out um but but but do something to connect
[01:20:55 --> 01:21:01]  to your provenance don't just let yourself be part of that opaque food system well I don't know
[01:21:01 --> 01:21:06]  where this came from I don't know who you know who this is I don't know anything about this um you
[01:21:06 --> 01:21:11]  know connect to your provenance and and get something with a label that you can read every single
[01:21:11 --> 01:21:16]  thing on the label know what it is and pronounce it so that's my recipe Ben uh getting your kitchen
[01:21:16 --> 01:21:23]  do something yourself and connect to your provenance fantastic and I will make sure to leave
[01:21:23 --> 01:21:28]  the links to your entire book collection you said you have 16 books is that right? Yes that's right
[01:21:28 --> 01:21:33]  amazing and that is I'm such a big fan of people who put their their work in their heart and
[01:21:33 --> 01:21:38]  soul into writing because that's such a permanent picture people can have in their home they can
[01:21:38 --> 01:21:42]  go out and sit and sit and the grass and the garden start visualizing these things as they're
[01:21:42 --> 01:21:47]  reading your book and really brought it all together so yeah um really recommend people check those
[01:21:47 --> 01:21:52]  out and start taking through your work to to get caught up and uh and there's so much other stuff
[01:21:52 --> 01:21:56]  I want to talk about but I know that you uh you have a very busy schedule which I love to see
[01:21:56 --> 01:22:01]  you're doing amazing work out there sir so thank you so much for joining me today Joel Salatin I
[01:22:01 --> 01:22:05]  appreciate you very much for everything that you're doing and for taking the time to talk with me
[01:22:05 --> 01:22:11]  it's been absolutely pleasure the delight's been all mine Ben yeah thank you
